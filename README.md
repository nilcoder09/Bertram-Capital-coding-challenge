#Who's Paying for Coffee Today?

This simple website helps you keep track of who paid for coffee in a group setting. It uses JavaScript and HTML to generate random names from a list, display them on the page, and record whether or not they have paid for coffee. The website removes the name of the person who has paid from the list until everyone else pays at least once. It displays this information on the screen, providing a fun way to track coffee payments in a group.

##Features

Random Name Display: Click the "Click here to know who's paying!" button to display a randomly selected name from the group.
Payment Confirmation: After someone pays for coffee, click the "Did the person pay for coffee? Click Here!" button to confirm the payment. The paid person's name will be removed from the list.
Restoration: Once everyone has paid at least once, the list is restored, allowing the process to begin again.
